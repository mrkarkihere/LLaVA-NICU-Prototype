# TRIAL 1 (INCORRECT)
**PROMPT (PPV video):** 
Considering the eight key actions (PPV, CPR, ETT, Drying, Pulse Oximeter, Reposition, Suction, and UVC) outlined in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, which action(s) are being performed in this video clip, and with what level of confidence? 

**RESPONSE:** 
In the video clip, the following actions are being performed by the healthcare professionals:
1. PPulse Oximeter: The healthcare professional is checking the baby's pulse oxygenation, which is a key action in neonatal resuscitation.
2. CPR: The healthcare professional is performing chest compressions, which is a key action in neonatal resuscitation.
3. Drying: The healthcare professional

# TRIAL 2 (SATISFACTORY)
**PROMPT:** 
The clinician is performing PPV on a neonate. List the visual indicators from the video that support this.

**RESPONSE:**
Based on the video, the clinician is performing a procedure called Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV) on a neonate. The visual indicators that support this include:
1. The neonate is connected to a ventilator or CPAP machine, which is used to provide breathing support to newborns.
2. The clinician is using a nasal cannula, which is a type of oxygen tube.

# TRIAL 3 (UNSATISFACTORY)
**PROMPT (PPV video):**
What is the likelihood that PPV is being performed in this video clip? Provide a confidence score (e.g., high, medium, low) to indicate your certainty.

**RESPONSE:**
Based on the image provided, it is difficult to definitively determine if PPV (Positive Pressure Ventilation) is being performed. However, given the context of a hospital setting and the presence of medical personnel, it is plausible that PPV could be a possibility. The likelihood of PPV being performed in this video clip is medium, as it is a common procedure in neonatal care.

# TRIAL 4 (CORRECT):
**PROMPT:**
Observe the actions in this video. Is the clinician drying the neonate? Describe the method being used and the purpose of this action

**RESPONSE:**
In the video, a group of healthcare professionals, including nurses and possibly other medical staff, are attending to a neonate (a newborn baby) in a hospital setting. One of the nurses is seen drying the baby's face with a towel, which is a common practice to clean and dry the baby's face after birth. The purpose of this action is to remove any residual fluids, such as amniotic fluid or vernix caseosa, which is a natural substance that protects the baby's skin during pregnancy. This helps to prevent infection and maintain a healthy skin barrier. The drying process is essential for the baby's comfort...

# TRIAL 5 (INCORRECT)
**PROMPT (Drying video):** 
Considering the eight key actions (PPV, CPR, ETT, Drying, Pulse Oximeter, Reposition, Suction, and UVC) outlined in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, which action is being performed in this video clip, and with what level of confidence? Briefly and only one action.

**RESPONSE:**
In the video clip, the action being performed is CPR (Chest Compression Resuscitation). The level of confidence in this action is very high.

# TRIAL 6 (SATISFACTORY)
**PROMPT (PPV video):**
What is the likelihood that drying is being performed on the baby? Provide a confidence score (e.g., high, medium, low) to indicate your certainty. Briefly.

**RESPONSE:**
The likelihood that drying is being performed on the baby is medium. The image shows a group of people, likely healthcare professionals, attending to a baby in a hospital setting. The baby is being dried, which is a common...

# NOTE
i noticed the lower the tokens is, the faster is runs (obvious now that i observe)
4 mins 45 secs for 50 tokens
6 min 45 secs for 100 tokens 
9 mins 45 secs for 150 tokens
(i somewhat rounded to 45s, but you can +/- 3 secs to those numbers)
