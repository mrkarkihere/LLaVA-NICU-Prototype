# Medical Procedure Prompt Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of prompt performance for medical procedure identification in video clips, including performance metrics, recommendations, and suggested improvements.

## Accuracy Analysis

### Overall Accuracy by Prompt Type

#### Prompt Type 1: Yes/No with 3 Visual Indicators
- **Format**: Question asking if specific procedure is being performed with requirement for 3 visual indicators
- **Accuracy**: 8/13 correct (61.5%)
- **Characteristics**: Detailed, structured response with visual evidence required
- **Strengths**: Forces justification and specific observation

#### Prompt Type 2: Single Main Procedure Identification
- **Format**: Direct identification of main procedure from list
- **Accuracy**: 6/13 correct (46.2%)
- **Characteristics**: Direct, single-answer focused
- **Weaknesses**: Lacks requirement for justification

#### Prompt Type 3: Select PRIMARY Action from List
- **Format**: Multiple choice selection of primary action
- **Accuracy**: 3/13 correct (23.1%)
- **Characteristics**: Multiple choice with focus on primary action
- **Weaknesses**: Too open-ended, lacks structured analysis

### Procedure-Specific Accuracy

| Procedure | Success Rate | Accuracy |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| PPV | 3/4 | 75% |
| ETT | 3/3 | 100% |
| CPR | 1/3 | 33.3% |
| Drying | 1/2 | 50% |
| Pulse Oximetry | 1/2 | 50% |
| Suction | 1/1 | 100% |
| Repositioning | 1/1 | 100% |

## Best Performing Elements

### Effective Features
1. Requirement for specific visual indicators
2. Binary (yes/no) initial questions
3. Structured response requirements
4. Confidence level ratings
5. Direct identification tasks

### Problematic Elements
1. Open-ended selection from multiple options
2. Lack of visual evidence requirements
3. Missing confidence ratings
4. Unstructured response formats

## Recommended Improved Prompts

### Prompt 1: Two-Stage Verification
```
Stage 1: Is [specific procedure] being performed in this clip? (Yes/No)
Stage 2: If Yes, provide exactly three distinct visual indicators that confirm this procedure. If No, explain what procedure is actually being performed with three visual indicators.
Confidence Level Required (High/Medium/Low)
```

### Prompt 2: Hierarchical Decision Tree
```
Follow these steps in order:
1. Is there direct patient contact/manipulation? (Yes/No)
2. Is any medical equipment being used? List specific items visible
3. Which of these procedures matches ALL observed actions:
   [list of procedures]
4. Provide 3 specific visual elements that confirm your choice
Confidence Level Required (High/Medium/Low)
```

### Prompt 3: Feature-Based Classification
```
Observe and report:
1. Location of healthcare provider's hands
2. Medical equipment present (if any)
3. Patient position and movement
4. Based ONLY on these observations, which ONE procedure from the following list matches ALL observed features:
   [list of procedures]
Confidence Level Required (High/Medium/Low)
```

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Structural Changes
1. **Mandatory Visual Evidence**
   - Require specific visual indicators
   - Force justification of classification
   - Include anatomical references

2. **Confidence Assessment**
   - Include confidence ratings for all responses
   - Identify uncertain predictions
   - Track correlation between confidence and accuracy

3. **Structured Observation**
   - Implement step-by-step analysis
   - Use decision tree approach
   - Focus on distinctive features

4. **Verification Steps**
   - Include double-checking mechanisms
   - Require ruling out similar procedures
   - Validate initial assessments

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Always require minimum of three visual indicators
2. Include confidence rating for each assessment
3. Use structured, step-by-step format
4. Require specific anatomical references
5. Include negative confirmation steps
6. Focus on distinguishing features between similar procedures

## Future Improvements

### Suggested Enhancements
1. Development of procedure-specific indicator lists
2. Creation of standardized visual feature checklist
3. Implementation of weighted scoring system
4. Integration of anatomical reference points
5. Development of procedure differentiation guidelines
