# dear diary...

we tried fine-tuning just to play around and running it off the checkpoint.
so all the scripts work as intended and i tried rerunning the same prompt on the original model vs the fine tuned.
the results were different so its safe to assume everything worked as intended.
going forward its a lot of optimizing and tweaking things around for results.
