# TRIAL 1 (INCORRECT)
**PROMPT (PPV video):** 
Considering the 8 key actions (PPV, CPR, ETT, Drying, Pulse Oximeter, Reposition, Suction, and UVC) outlined in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, which action(s) are being performed in this video clip, and with what level of confidence? 

**RESPONSE:** 
In the video clip, the following actions are being performed by the healthcare professionals:
1. Pulse Oximeter: The healthcare professional is checking the baby's pulse oxygenation, which is a key action in neonatal resuscitation.
2. CPR: The healthcare professional is performing chest compressions, which is a key action in neonatal resuscitation.
3. Drying: The healthcare professional

# TRIAL 2 (CORRECT)
**PROMPT:** 
The clinician is performing PPV on a neonate. List the visual indicators from the video that support this.

**RESPONSE:**
Based on the video, the clinician is performing a procedure called Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV) on a neonate. The visual indicators that support this include:
1. The neonate is connected to a ventilator or CPAP machine, which is used to provide breathing support to newborns.
2. The clinician is using a nasal cannula, which is a type of oxygen tube.

# TRIAL 3 (UNSATISFACTORY)
**PROMPT (PPV video):**
What is the likelihood that PPV is being performed in this video clip? Provide a confidence score (e.g., high, medium, low) to indicate your certainty.

**RESPONSE:**
Based on the image provided, it is difficult to definitively determine if PPV (Positive Pressure Ventilation) is being performed. However, given the context of a hospital setting and the presence of medical personnel, it is plausible that PPV could be a possibility. The likelihood of PPV being performed in this video clip is medium, as it is a common procedure in neonatal care.

**SIDE NOTE:** it says its moderately confident that it is PPV so i guess we'll leave it as an unsatisfactory result

# TRIAL 4 (CORRECT):
**PROMPT:**
Observe the actions in this video. Is the clinician drying the neonate? Describe the method being used and the purpose of this action

**RESPONSE:**
In the video, a group of healthcare professionals, including nurses and possibly other medical staff, are attending to a neonate (a newborn baby) in a hospital setting. One of the nurses is seen drying the baby's face with a towel, which is a common practice to clean and dry the baby's face after birth. The purpose of this action is to remove any residual fluids, such as amniotic fluid or vernix caseosa, which is a natural substance that protects the baby's skin during pregnancy. This helps to prevent infection and maintain a healthy skin barrier. The drying process is essential for the baby's comfort...

# TRIAL 5 (INCORRECT)
**PROMPT (Drying video):** 
Considering the 8 key actions (PPV, CPR, ETT, Drying, Pulse Oximeter, Reposition, Suction, and UVC) outlined in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, which action is being performed in this video clip, and with what level of confidence? Briefly and only one action.

Observe the actions in this video. Is the clinician performing CPR on the neonate? Describe the method being used and the purpose of this action. Briefly.

**RESPONSE:**
In the video, a clinician is seen performing CPR on a neonate, which is a newborn baby. The clinician is using a bag-valve mask, which is a type of manual resuscitator, to provide..

# TRIAL 11 (INCORRECT)
**PROMPT (PulseOximeter video):** 
Identify the primary action in this clip. Does this action align with one of the core actions (e.g., Pulse Oximeter) intended to stabilize the neonate?

**RESPONSE:**
The primary action in this clip is the administration of oxygen to the neonate. This is a key neonatal resuscitation procedure, as oxygen is a critical component of neonatal care and can help stabilize the neonate by improving oxygenation and reducing the risk of hypoxemia. The nurses are using a nasal cannula to deliver oxygen to the baby, which is a common method for providing supplemental oxygen to...

**SIDE NOTE:** this prompt is absolutely terrible. i ran 6 trials with different variations and all the results came out ambiguous

# TRIAL 12 (CORRECT)
**PROMPT (CPR2 video):** 
What action step does this segment represent within the neonatal resuscitation procedure? List only if it corresponds to the defined steps, like 'chest compressions' or 'suctioning.

**RESPONSE:**
The image shows a medical team performing a neonatal resuscitation procedure. The action step represented in this segment is "CPR" (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation).

# TRIAL 15 (UNSATISFACTORY)
**PROMPT (Reposition video):** 
Considering the 8 key actions (PPV, CPR, ETT, Drying, Pulse Oximeter, Reposition, Suction, and UVC) outlined in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, which action is being performed in this video clip, and with what level of confidence? Briefly and only one action.

**RESPONSE:**
In the video, the action being performed is "ETT" (Endotracheal Tube), which is a key action in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program. The level of confidence in this action being performed is very high, as it is a critical step in the resuscitation process for newborns.

**SIDE NOTE:** in this video, ETT is also being performed but it was a repositioning clip. so it focused on the wrong task.

# TRIAL 16 (INCORRECT)
**PROMPT (Suction video):** 
Considering the 8 key actions (PPV, CPR, ETT, Drying, Pulse Oximeter, Reposition, Suction, and UVC) outlined in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, which action is being performed in this video clip, and with what level of confidence? Briefly and only one action.

**RESPONSE:**
The action being performed in this video clip is PPV (Positive Pressure Ventilation), which is a key action in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program. The level of confidence in this action is very high, as it is a critical step in resuscitating a newborn baby.

# TRIAL 17 (UNSATISFACTORY)
**PROMPT (UVC video):** 
Considering the 8 key actions (PPV, CPR, ETT, Drying, Pulse Oximeter, Reposition, Suction, and UVC) outlined in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, which action is being performed in this video clip, and with what level of confidence? Briefly and only one action.

**RESPONSE:**
In the video, the action being performed is CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation). The level of confidence in this action is very high, as it is a critical component of neonatal resuscitation and is being performed by a healthcare professional who is trained to do so.

**SIDE NOTE:** so in this video, the person is performing CPR as well as UVC but we wanted to focus on UVC. so it wasn't technically wrong and marked as unsatisfactory.

# TRIAL 18 (CORRECT)
**PROMPT (ETT2 video):** 
What action step does this segment represent within the neonatal resuscitation procedure? List only if it corresponds to the defined steps, like 'chest compressions' or 'ETT'.

**RESPONSE:**
This segment represents the step of intubation in the neonatal resuscitation procedure.

# NOTE
i noticed the lower the tokens is, the faster is runs (obvious now that i observe)
2 mins 45 secs to 4 mins 45 secs for 50 tokens (varies for some reason)
6 min 45 secs for 100 tokens 
9 mins 45 secs for 150 tokens
(i somewhat rounded to 45s, but you can +/- 3 secs to those numbers)

videos like pulse ox, suction, reposition, and any videos that has multiple hands or actions almost always come out to be incorrect.

videos that are CLEAR with a single action being performed (no matter how complex) are almost always correct.

# Prompt Analysis
- best performing are CPR actions (100% accuracy)
- PPV, ETT, Drying are mixed performing (50%-66%)
- rest all performed terribly (0%)
- Best performing prompts are those that are clear, focused, provides examples such as **"What action step does this segment represent within the neonatal resuscitation procedure? List only if it corresponds to the defined steps, like 'chest compressions' or 'ETT'."**
- Another best performing prompt is one that forces focus on single action such as **"Observe the actions in this video. Is the clinician performing [specific action]? Describe the method being used and the purpose of this action."**
- we've also come to a realization that prompts should specify actions such as "ETT" to Endotracheal intubation since "ETT" could refer to a variety of actions.

## Suggested Future Prompts
- "Among the following actions (positive pressure ventilation, chest compressions, Endotracheal intubation, Drying, Pulse Oximetry, Reposition, Suction, Umbilical Venous Catheter), what is the PRIMARY action being performed? Focus only on the most prominent procedure visible in the clip."
- "Is [specific action] being performed in this clip? Provide three visual indicators that support your answer. Confidence: High/Medium/Low"
- **NOTE:** do NOT use this prompt, it always rambles on "Compare the movement patterns in this clip to known procedures. Is this X or Y?"
- "Identify the single main medical procedure being performed. If it matches one of these key actions (positive pressure ventilation, chest compressions, Endotracheal intubation, Drying, Pulse Oximetry, Reposition, Suction, Umbilical Venous Catheter), name it"
